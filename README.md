# Fastfetch

[Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) is a tool for fetching system information and displaying them in a elegant way. In this repo, I collect my config files that I designed for my powersehll enviroment. Feel free to copy files and modify them or clone the complete repository.

## Usage

To use your Fastfetch configuration:

1. Browse through the available config files and select your preferred one.
2. If required, copy the corresponding images or ASCII-art files.
3. Rename the selected config file to `config.jsonc`.
4. Move the renamed file to `~/.config/fastfetch`.
5. Run Fastfetch using the command:

```bash
   fastfetch
```

## Compatibility

These configurations have been designed primarily for use in PowerShell environments. Some settings or features may require adjustments to work on other platforms like Linux or macOS.

## Customization

You can customize the output by editing the `config.jsonc` file. Modify or add new fields for system information, colors, or ASCII art to personalize the display further. Visit the Fastfetch documentation for more detailed options.
